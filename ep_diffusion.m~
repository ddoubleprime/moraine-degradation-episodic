% ep_diffusion.m
% 
% Numerically diffuses a moraine profile as a function of time, based on an input
% initial profile. Diffusivity is input each call so it can change for
% different time periods. Profile is input each period as well so can be
% externally modified eg resteepened by an advective erosion process. 
% 
% Syntax: [times, crest_height, distances, final_profile] = ep_diffusion(distances, initial_profile, k, ...
%    time_interval, dt_external)
% times, vector of elapsed time values in increments of dt_ext (yr)
% crest_height, height of moraine crest as a function of the values in the
%   vector times (m)
% final_profile, height of moraine as a function of the values in the
%   vector distances (m)

% distances, vector of distance from the moraine crest (m) 
    % these should be EQUALLY SPACED as dx used by the diffusion code wil
    % be calculated from the second-first interval in distances
% initial_profile, height of moraine as a function of the values in the
%   vector distances (m)
% k, topographic diffusion coefficient (sq. m/ yr)
% time_interval, period over which to iterate the diffusion (yr)
% dt_external, interval between reports of moraine height (yr)

%% Calculate new moraine profile as a function of distance from the
%% moraine's crest.

% Take input profile and numerically diffuse it for input time period
% calculate dx
dx = distances(2)-distances(1); % does not assume a zero distance for first cell

outer_bound = initial_profile(end);

% internal timestep is independent of dt_ext and is defined based on courant criterion
t_step = 1; % replace with courant calculation
time = 0:t_step:time_interval;

% do the diffusion
active_profile = initial_profile;
crest = zeros(size(time));
t_count = 0;

    active_profile(1) = active_profile(2);  % no-slope at crest
    
    for dinc=2:length(profile-1)

        active_profile(dinc) = profile_prev(dinc) + k*(t_step/(dx^2))*(profile_prev(dinc+1) - 2*profile_prev(dinc) + profile_prev(dinc-1));
